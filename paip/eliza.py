"""
**Eliza** is a pattern-matching automated psychiatrist.  Given a set of rules
in the form of input/output patterns, Eliza will attempt to recognize user input
phrases and generate relevant psychobabble responses.

Each rule is specified by an input pattern and a list of output patterns.  A
pattern is a sentence consisting of space-separated words and variables.  Input
pattern variables come in two forms: single variables and segment variables;
single variables (which take the form `?x`) match a single word, while segment
variables (which take the form `?*x`) can match a phrase.  Output pattern
variables are only single variables.  The variable names contained in an input
pattern should be the same as those in the corresponding output pattern, and
each segment variable `?*x` in an input pattern corresponds to the single
variable `?x` in the output pattern.

The conversation proceeds by reading a sentence from the user, searching through
the rules to find an input pattern that matches, replacing variables in the
output pattern, and printing the results to the user.

For examples of using this scheme, see the following programs:

- [Eliza](examples/eliza/eliza.html)
- [Automated technical support system](examples/eliza/support.html)

This implementation is inspired by Chapter 5 of "Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence Programming" by Peter Norvig.
